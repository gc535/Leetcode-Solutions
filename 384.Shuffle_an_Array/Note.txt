Given an integer array nums, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. All permutations of the array should be equally likely as a result of the shuffling.

Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
int[] reset() Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
int[] shuffle() Returns a random shuffling of the array.


sol:
Perfect Even Shuffle (knuth shuffle algo) 
goal: every element should be equally likely to show up in any location.

for i in (n-1, 0):
    pos = rand(0, i)
    swap(arr[i], arr[pos])
