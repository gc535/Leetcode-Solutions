Given the root of a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees.
For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.
Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with the same node values.

example: 
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,2,4,null,null,4]
Output: [[2,4],[4]]

Sol: post order serialization, or pre-order
val + left_serial + right_serial
Note: 
1. Inorder wont work. Becasue it cannot determine a unique tree. (try )

    0
   / \
 #    0
     / \
    #    #   
    
and 

       0
      / \
    0    #
   / \
  #   #
  
save all subtree in a map for counting.
