Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.

sol:
1. suppose current char are "ab", so there are 3 unique substrings: a, b, ab
2. every new char should add (n + 1) new substrings
3. if new char is used before, (eg. abb), then it will double count the substrings brings by first b used, we should deduct them.

thus, we need to know
how many substr that each new char brings in. if new char used mutiple times, we should sum the new substring they bring in.
how many unique substr in total we have right now.
