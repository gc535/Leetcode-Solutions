sol: 

attempt 1:  O(N^2)
iterate from backwards
1. if current val > dist to the end, mark yes
2. or if current val, can reach any pos with "yes" mark, mark yes





attmep 2: O(N)
iterate from backwards
use range records "min_left"
1. if current val > dist to the end, update min_left = cur_i
2. else if cur_i + val >= min_left, update min_left = cur_i
