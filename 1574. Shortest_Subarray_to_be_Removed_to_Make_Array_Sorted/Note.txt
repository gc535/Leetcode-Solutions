Given an integer array arr, remove a subarray (can be empty) from arr such that the remaining elements in arr are non-decreasing.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.

[1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5] -> [1,2,3,3,5]  (remove 3)


sol 

attempt 1:

min/max index + binary search

1. create min index pos array
    eg. [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5] -> [2, 2, 2, 2,  2,  2,  3,  5] 
2. starting from index 0 of original array, using binary search in index array to find first greater pos.

O(nlogn)

attemp2:
1. find left, right point where both array are sorted order.
2. while i < left and j < right, iterate two pointer to record max len.

O(N)
